What is AWS S3?
AWS Simple Storage Service(S3) provides secure, durable and highly scalable object storage. S3 is easy to use and we can store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

NOTE: Every S3 bucket must be unique and that why random id is useful to prevent our bucket to collide with others.
LifeCycle Management
Why do we need LifeCycle Management?
To save cost
In most of the cases, data which is generated by our application is relevant for us for the first 30 days and after that, we donâ€™t access that data as frequently.
